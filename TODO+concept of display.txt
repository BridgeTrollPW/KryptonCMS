Basic concept of displaying content via Krypton CMS:

Page object is what lays at the bottom of everything displayed while a page object can still dynamically change it's content.

A Page object has a template, content blocks including text and custom functions or variables that will automatically be inserted into the template
content blocks will also be inserted into the template, yet they can either be local to one page or global and loaded from every page, not restricted by its locality
